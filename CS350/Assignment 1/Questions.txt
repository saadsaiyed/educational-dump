    1. Briefly explain the main criteria in evaluating a programming
       language.  Compare two programming languages of your choice 
       based on these criteria.

    2. Discuss three possible ways to classify programming languages into
       different classes.  Explain what are the main functions of each
       of the classification methods.

    3. Describe three perspectives/views on programming languages (i.e.,
       user, designer, and implementer).
 
    4. Find an article or a book chapter on the philosophy or principles of
       UNIX operating systems.  Discuss two particular principles
       and explain their connections to programming languages. 

    5. Find a paper or a book on structured programming.
       Briefly describe the main ideas of structured programming.
       (Provide complete reference information of the paper or book.)

    6. Read the paper:
       Donald E. Knuth, Literate Programming.
       Give a brief summary of "Literate Programming."

    7. Describe influences of computer architectures and
       programming methodology on the development of programming
       languages.

    8. Draw float charts of three basic control structures.

    9. Draw a flowchart to find the maximum value and the minimum value
       of a list of N numbers, where N >= 1. 
       Identify the basic control blocks in your flowchart.

   10. Draw a flowchart to find the maximum value and the minimum value
       of a list of positive numbers, where -1 indicates the end of the list. 
       Identify the basic control blocks in your flowchart.
